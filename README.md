Here is a brief and clear introduction to HTML, CSS, and jQuery, perfect for beginners

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is the structure of a web page.
It tells the browser what content to display.

🔹 Used for:

Headings

Paragraphs

Images

Buttons

Layout structure

🔹 Example:

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This is a webpage</p>

➡️ Think of HTML as the skeleton of a website.

🎨 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is used to style the web page.
It controls colors, layout, fonts, size, and animations.

🔹 Used for:

Colors & fonts

Layout (flex, grid)

Animations & transitions

Responsive design

🔹 Example:

h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 30px;
}


➡️ Think of CSS as the skin and clothes of the website.

⚡ jQuery

jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes JavaScript easier.
It helps to add interactivity and animations quickly.

🔹 Used for:

Click events

Animations

DOM manipulation

AJAX calls

🔹 Example:

$("button").click(function () {
    alert("Button clicked!");
});


➡️ Think of jQuery as the muscles that make the page move and respond.
